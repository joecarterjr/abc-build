			  <p>Dear Lisa,</p>
			  <p>It was great interviewing with you, David, and Regan yesterday; you all seem to have a really cohesive team and I hope I get to be a part of that. Thanks for taking some time to share more about your experience and how you've grown within TEKsystems. </p>
			  
			<p>I'm looking forward to learning more from you and providing my own knowledge &amp; expertise to the benefit of the company. After our meeting I feel even more confident that I will be a valuable member of the online marketing team and that the camaraderie &amp; team atmosphere will allow me to thrive.</p>
						
			<p>In closing, I hope that we get an opportunity to work together soon and in the meantime you have a great day.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Regards</p>
			<p>Joseph Anthony Brown</p>
