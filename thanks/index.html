			  <p>Dear Ms. Baum,</p>
			  <p>I'm glad that we had the opportunity to talk yesterday, I was filled with a great excitement and hopefulness after leaving our interview. This hopeful excitement is born of an even stronger feeling that Bryn Mawr is the right place for me to pair my skills &amp; passion for design with my desire to advance a worthwhile mission and be part of a strong team. I can't wait for the opportunity to further the awesome work Courtney has started&mdash;in my own way, of course; not to mention that the genuine care &amp; concern for what you do is evident, and who doesn't want to work with people who really value what they do?</p>
			  
			  <p>Either way, thank you so much for taking time out of your busy day to share more about yourself, Bryn Mawr, and how the graphic designer role meshes with the team &amp; impacts the school. I am grateful to be selected as a final candidate, I look forward to hearing back from you soon with a decision and hopefully being the person you choose.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Regards</p>
			<p>Joseph Anthony Brown</p>
