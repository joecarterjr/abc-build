			  <p>Dear David,</p>
			  <p>Thanks for sitting in on the interview yesterday and taking some time to answer my questions about the systems &amp; processes there at TEKsystems.</p>
			  
			<p>I look forward to seeing the move into Sitecore 8 and helping TEKsystems make that transition. I hope that I'll be chosen to join the online marketing team and that we'll have the opportunity to work together in the future.</p>
						
			<p>In closing, thank you again for your time and have a great day.</p>
			<br />
			<p>Regards</p>
			<p>Joseph Anthony Brown</p>
